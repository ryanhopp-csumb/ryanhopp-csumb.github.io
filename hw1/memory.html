    <h1>Memory Management</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        For memory management, each computer has a virtual address space and a physical address space.<br>
        Any process that can access memory only gets to see a set of virtual addresses and no physical addresses.<br>
        This means that processes can use more memory than the computer physically has with no issue.<br>
        However, this also means that we have to keep some way of translating the virtual addresses to physical addresses.<br>
        There are a few different approaches to doing this address translation, <strong>such as:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Base and bounds</strong> - All virtual addresses for a process are between a base and a bounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Segmentation</strong> - Processes get different segments of memory for their virtual address space.</li>
            <li><strong>Paging</strong> - Every process gets some number of memory pages to use, all virtual addresses are on the page(s) given.</li>
        </ol>
